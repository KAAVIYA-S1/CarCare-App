# CarCareApp (MVP)

This is a minimal React Native (Expo) MVP for a Car Care application.

Features:
- Signup/Login (local)
- Dashboard with cars and upcoming services
- Add/Edit/Delete cars
- Service history listing
- Local persistence with AsyncStorage
- Sample demo data preloaded
- Basic navigation

Getting started (Windows PowerShell):

1. Install dependencies (requires Node.js & npm):

   npm install -g expo-cli
   npm install

2. Start the app:

   expo start

3. Run on Android/iOS simulator or the Expo Go app.

Notes:
- This is an MVP with local-only storage (no backend).
- Push notifications are scaffolded but require additional setup for standalone builds.
- Optional: install extra packages for camera, image picker, or Firebase.
